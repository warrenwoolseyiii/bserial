bserial
bserial is a simple command line interface for communicating with a serial port device. It reads all incoming data from the serial port and prints it to the console, and it also allows the user to send data to the serial port by typing it into the console.

Installation
You can install bserial using pip, the Python package manager. First, clone the repository and cd into the top-level directory:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/bserial.git
cd bserial
Then, install the package using pip:

Copy code
pip install .
This will install bserial and its dependencies.

Usage
To use bserial, you need to provide the name of the serial port device and the baud rate of the serial connection as command line arguments. For example, to connect to a device on /dev/ttyUSB0 at a baud rate of 9600, you can run:

css
Copy code
bserial -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600
Once the connection is established, bserial will start reading data from the serial port and printing it to the console. You can also send data to the serial port by typing it into the console and pressing Enter. To exit the program, press Ctrl-C.
